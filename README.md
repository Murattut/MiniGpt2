# Your MiniGpt2

## Overview
This repository contains a GPT-2 variant implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. This variant extends upon the capabilities of the original GPT-2 model with additional features or modifications.

## Features

- **GPT-2 Variant**: This project implements a variant of OpenAI's GPT-2 language model.
- **fastest torch Implementation**: Utilizes newest technic for efficiency and performance.
- **Text Generation**: Generates human-like text based on input prompts using the trained GPT-2 model.


## Requirements
  - Python 3.x (tested on 3.11)
  - PyTorch 2.x (tested on 2.2.2)
  - CUDA (if using GPU acceleration)

## Installation
- Provide instructions for installing any necessary dependencies and setting up the environment.

To use, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/Murattut/MiniGpt2.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    
    cd MiniGpt2
    ```
3. Install requirements
    ```bash
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   

## Usage (under development)
- Explain how to use your GPT-2 variant, including any command-line arguments or configuration options.
- Provide examples of how to generate text or fine-tune the model.
- For example:
  ```bash
  python generate_text.py --input_text "Once upon a time, there was a"
  ```

## Training (under development)
- If applicable, provide instructions for training your GPT-2 variant on custom datasets.
- Include details such as data preprocessing, training parameters, and any additional steps required.
- For example:
  ```bash
  python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --num_epochs 10
  ```
